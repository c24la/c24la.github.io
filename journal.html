Journal Entry #1:

Today we connected our home page to our different sections in the website. I connected each of my letters to a different page that will be used! I also put my website online! My next step is to create my first project in the theme of a present. I am excited to get the hang of using terminal, sublime.text, and javascript!

This weekend I uploaded my first journal entry for this previous week. I showed my family what my website looks like so far and described the vision for it. I tried to generate some ideas for my first present project!

Hello! Today I worked at home to finish up my soccer CSS animation. It is really cool how I am learning new skills and adding more to my mental computer science tool box! I am happy I created my first project on my own!

Journal Entry #4

Hello! Right now I am working on making sure that everything I want to be on my website so far is being displayed. I am also making sure that my website is coherent and appealing to look at. I have some things to catch up on because I have missed some classes, so I am excited to be prepared and up to date with my projects and website.

Journal Entry #5

Hello! Yesterday I had a lab and I really think that I have a better understanding of functions. This is perfect because I am getting more practice right now in class since we have a function puzzle! We are creating a dinasaur out of a cookie! I'm testing different codes and seeing what works. I learned that a function just like a recipe and that CSS, javascript, and HTML are all connected! Some tips for debugging that I should pay attention to is... 1. Check to see if you have any typos! 2. Look in the console to see if there any errors! 3. Did you "call" your function by saying its name with parentheses! 4. Does your div actually have height and width - you can check this elements tag! 5. Maybe your image isn't covering your div-- or give it a background color--! 6. Is your image actually in the folder where it's supposed to be! I'm excited to see where my website goes!

Journal Entry #6

Hi journal! Today I did not have class but I had a chance to read about RGB color. RGB colors are the colors (red, green, and blue), these colors are used for digital images and electronic displays. The colors red, green, and blue are used because they correlate and correspond with the pixels used to display electronic images. I am excited for class to perfect and add on to my website! I know also have the useful debuggin tips from the journal entry above!

Journal Entry #7

Hello journal! I am currently in the process of working on my gift for sister's birthday. The gift is going to represent the people in Eloise's (my sister's) life who love her. I hope she will like it! I am learning that once you understand more basic setups for creating boxes and styling, creating a website becomes easier! I can't wait to add more to my project!

Journal Entry #8
Hi journal! Sorry it's been awhile! I am very happy because I have now created a Valentine's day present for my friend Stori. I created five divs to create five different hearts that when you click on them they say five things I love about Stori. It was fun to make and I feel like I got a better understanding for how something as simple as divs work. I also now understand that there are other ways of doing this process. I could have used a funtion which would have been the better choice to use if I was making let's say 1000 hearts and created a variable and and told the funtion to add a heart through adding a number to the variable. I am excited to see what is to come and to upload this to my website. I am considering making some more simple Valentine's presents for my other friends or family!

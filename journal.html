Journal Entry #1:

Today we connected our home page to our different sections in the website. I connected each of my letters to a different page that will be used! I also put my website online! My next step is to create my first project in the theme of a present. I am excited to get the hang of using terminal, sublime.text, and javascript!

This weekend I uploaded my first journal entry for this previous week. I showed my family what my website looks like so far and described the vision for it. I tried to generate some ideas for my first present project!

Hello! Today I worked at home to finish up my soccer CSS animation. It is really cool how I am learning new skills and adding more to my mental computer science tool box! I am happy I created my first project on my own!

Journal Entry #4

Hello! Right now I am working on making sure that everything I want to be on my website so far is being displayed. I am also making sure that my website is coherent and appealing to look at. I have some things to catch up on because I have missed some classes, so I am excited to be prepared and up to date with my projects and website.
